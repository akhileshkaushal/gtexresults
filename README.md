## What's included

This repo contains some of the original scripts used to produce results
from Urbut et al. 

If you want to run mashr for yourself, we suggest starting with
the software available [here](https://github.com/stephenslab/mashr).

## Using this Repo

In this directory, under the folder *workflows* you will find the
notated script, `gtex6_mash_analysis.ipynb** to reproduce the GTEx results found in
Urbut et al.

*More instructions to come*

The input data necessary to run this analysis is
all available under inputs. This may take some time to run.
We have provided
the outputs of running mash in `Data_vhat`.

This repo is organized so that you can run Mash using the gteX data
contained in **Inputs** to produce the parameters and posteriors from
mashr.

### Figure plotting

The directory **Plots_for_Paper_vmat** contains .Rmd files to plot figures from the paper,
using our results which are provided in **Results_Data**. 

[Here is the link to the index](https://stephenslab.github.io/gtexresults_mash)
discussing the reproduction of all of the plots.
