## Overview

This repository contains code resources to accompany our research
paper:

> Sarah M. Urbut, Gao Wang and Matthew Stephens (2017). *Flexible
> statistical methods for estimating and testing effects in genomic
> studies with multiple conditions.* bioRxiv
> [doi:10.1101/096552][biorxiv-paper].

We provide three sets of code resources:

1. If you are primarily interested in applying the multivariate adaptive
   shrinkage (*mash*) methods to your own data, please see the
   [mashr repository][mashr].

2. If you are working with association statistics from the
   [GTEx study][gtex], or similar genetic association data, please see
   [here](fastqtl2mash.html) for our code to convert association
   statistics in the [FastQTL][fastqtl] format, or a similar format,
   to a format that is more suitable for analysis with *mashr*.

3. If you would like follow the exact steps we took to produce the
   results of the GTEx analysis presented in the manuscript, follow
   the instructions [here](gtex.html).
