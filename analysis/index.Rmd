## Overview

This repository contains code and data resources to accompany our
research paper:

> Sarah M. Urbut, Gao Wang and Matthew Stephens (2017). *Flexible
> statistical methods for estimating and testing effects in genomic
> studies with multiple conditions.* bioRxiv
> [doi:10.1101/096552][biorxiv-paper].

We provide four sets of resources:

1. If you are primarily interested in applying the multivariate adaptive
   shrinkage (*mash*) methods to your own data, please see the
   [mashr R package][mashr].

2. If you would like to obtain the exact GTEx association statistics
   used in the multivariate adaptive shrinkage (*mash*) analysis
   described in our research paper (e.g., so you can apply your method
   of choice to these data, and compare against our results), please
   see [here](gtexdata.html).

3. If you would like follow the exact steps we took to produce the
   results of the GTEx analysis presented in the manuscript, follow
   the instructions [here](gtexanalysis.html). **Note:** The mashr
   package was not used in this analysis because mashr was only
   developed afterward.

4. If you are working with association statistics from the
   [GTEx study][gtex], or similar genetic association data, please see
   [here](fastqtl2mash.html) for our code to convert association
   statistics in the [FastQTL][fastqtl] format, or a similar format,
   to a format that is more suitable for analysis with *mash*.

## What's included in the git repository

See [here][gtexresults] for the source repository. This is what
you will find in the repository:

```
├── analysis
├── code
├── data

```

+ The **analysis** contains R Markdown source files for the workflowr
  website, including R code used in the final step of the analysis to
  generate figures and tables for the manuscript.

+ The **code** directory contains additional supporting code for the
  analyses.

+ The **data** directory contains original and processed data files
  used in the mash analysis of the GTEx data, example data sets used
  to illustrate the data processing and analysis pipelines, and
  additional data used to generate the tables and figures for the
  manuscript.

+ The **docs** directory contains webpages generated from the R
  Markdown files in the analysis directory.

+ The **output** stores outputs from data processing and analysis
  pipelines ("workflows").

+ The **workflows** directory contains source code ("SoS workflows")
  and Docker configuration files ("Dockerfiles") implementing a data
  processing pipeline for mash and an end-to-end analysis of the GTEx
  data using the multivariate statistical methods ("mash").
