to do items
===========

* Copy to "output" all the results that are necessary to produce the
  figures and tables (Gao).
* Merge README.md with code/master_mash_analysis.ipynb (Peter). (@pcarbo: I noticed you essentially added some notes to annotate `MidwayScript.Rmd` in README.md. If you still want to keep those notes you can take what you think is useful from README.md, open code/master_mash_analysis.ipynb add add to it, before you remove the README.md)
